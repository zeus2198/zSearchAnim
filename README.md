# Usage
Initializing the element with the magifying glass:
```javascript
var mySearchAnim = new zSearchAnim("targetID", {
    //optional, default values are mentioned below along with options
    dimension: '250px', // diameter of the circle
    color: '#000', // color of circle and arms
    circleWidth: '5px', // circle border width
    armWidth: '5%' // magnifying glass and clock's arm's width, the percent width is relative to the dimension option.
});
```
Starting the animation:

mySearchAnim.searchStart();
```
